This is a real time chat app built with the MERN webstack ie. MongoDB, React, Node and Express.
Uses Socket.io for real time communication between users.
Messages are not persistant, so refreshing the page will clear the chat history.
Currently the login button is a dummy login system, though it still creates a userId.
PS: The box at the top right is for custom names of rooms, defaulting to "New Room" if left empty.
